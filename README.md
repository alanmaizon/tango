  - Allow users to register, log in, and update their profiles.

- **Password Recovery:**
  - Set up email-based password recovery using Django's password reset views.

### **2. Data Storage**
**Enhancements:**

### **4. Security Features**
**Enhancements:**
- **Password Encryption:**

- **Prevent CSRF Attacks:**
  - Use Django’s CSRF middleware for form submissions.

- **Role-Based Access Control:**

**Steps:**
